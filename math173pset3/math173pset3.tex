As the hint suggests, $u' = 0$ means by definition $u(\phi) = 0$ for any $\phi \in C_c^\infty(\RR)$. For any $\psi \in \Cc$, let $\phi_0\in \Cc$ be a bump function such that $\int_\RR \phi_0(x)dx = 1$. Let $\hat{\psi} = \psi - \phi_0\int_\RR\psi(x)dx$. We see that 
\[\int_\RR \hat{\psi}(x)dx = \int_\RR \psi(x)dx -\int_R\psi(x)dx\cdot \int_\RR\phi_0(x)dx =\int_\RR \psi(x)dx-\int_\RR \psi(x)dx = 0.\]
So, we can let 
\[\phi(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x \hat{\psi}(x) dx.\]
We see $\hat{\psi}$ has compact support and is in $\Cc$ (since it is the sum of two compact support functions). Since $\int_\RR \hat{\psi}(x)dx = 0$, we know $\phi$ must have compact support as well and be in $\Cc$. Now, let $c = u(\phi_0)$. We see that by linearity of $u$,
\[u(\psi) = u(\hat{\psi}) + u(\phi_0)\cdot \int_\RR\psi(x)dx = u(\phi') + c\int_\RR\psi(x)dx =0+  c\int_\RR\psi(x)dx=c\int_\RR\psi(x)dx, \]
which is exactly what we wanted to prove.

First, let us define $f(x-ct)$ in a way that aligns with the case that $f$ is a nice function. We see that if $f$ were nice, then
\begin{align*}
    f(x-ct)(\phi)&= \int_{\RR^2}f(x-ct)\phi(t,x)dxdt \\
    &= \int_{\RR^2}f(z)\phi(s,z+cs)dzds \\
    &= \int_{\RR^2}f(z)\phi(s,z+cs)dsdz \\
    & = \int_{z \in \RR} f(z) \int_{s \in \RR} \phi(s,z+cs)ds dz\\
    &= f\del{\int_{t \in \RR}\phi(t,z+ct)dt}. 
\end{align*}
So, we see that $f(x-ct)(\phi) = f(\Phi)$ where $\Phi = \int_\RR \phi(s,z+cs)ds$. Note that $\Phi \in \Cc$ because the integral of a smooth function is smooth and $\phi$ is compactly supported. So, we can define $u = f(x-ct)$. 
\hop 
Now, we must show that $u$ satisfies the PDE. This is done by simply writing out our definition and using the linearity of $f$. More precisely, 
\begin{align*}
    (u_t + cu_x)(\phi) &= -f\del{\int_s \phi_t(s, z +cs) ds} -cf\del{\int_s \phi_x(s, z +cs) ds} \\
    &= -f\del{\int_s \sbr{\phi_t(s, z +cs) +s\phi_x(s, z +cs)} ds} \\
    & = -f\del{\int_s\d_s \phi(s,z+cs) ds)}\\
    &= -f(0) \\
    &= 0.
\end{align*} 
Note that we used the fundamental theorem of calculus, that $\phi$ has compact support, and that $f$ is linear in the above computation. 
\hop 
Thus, $u = f(x-ct)$ by definition and $u$ solves the PDE in the sense of distribution, as we wanted to show.

We assume $t \ge 0$, as always. First, lets' consider the case $c =0$. Then, we have $u_{tt} = 0$, so $u_t(x,t)$ is constant along the line $\{(t,x_0)\}$ for any $x_0$. So, $u(t,x)$ has is a line of constant slope along any $\{(t,x_0)\}$. The starting point and the slope are defined by the initial conditions, so we see that 
\[u(t,x) = \phi(x) + t\psi(x).\]
This vanishes when $\phi(0) + t\psi =0$. Since $\phi, \psi$ are positive, $\phi$ must be $0$, so $|x| \ge 1$. Any point where $|x| \ge 1$ works. 
\hop 
We can also check that $u$ is linear (and thus $C^\infty$) everywhere except for the places where of $\phi$ and $\psi$ are not $C^\infty$. In other words $u$ is $C^\infty$ when $x \ne -1,0,1$. 
\hop
Now, let's look at the nonzero case. We know from the notes that the solution is 
\[u(t,x) = \frac{1}{2}(\phi(x+ct) + \phi(x-ct)) + \frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct}\psi(\sigma) d\sigma.\]
Notice that we can assume $c > 0$ because $c < 0$ would also flip the integral, leading to the same solution. 
\hop 
We see that $\phi, \psi$ are non-negative, so this vanishes only when $\phi(x-ct)=0, \phi(x+c)=0$, and $\psi = 0$ on the interval $(x-ct,x+ct)$. For the analysis of when $u$ vanishes, we will only consider $c =1$.  Instead of writing out the cases, consider the following picture of where this is true:

TODO: image

We see that $u$ is $C^\infty$ everywhere but the discontinuities of $\phi, \psi$. In other words, $u$ is $C^\infty$ when $x+ct \ne -1, 0$, or 1. \qed

As the hint suggests, consider $v(x_0, x_n, t) = u(x_0, x_n, t) - u(x_0, -x_n, t)$. Notice that 
\[v_{tt} - c^2\Delta_xv = u_{tt}(x_0, x_n, t) - u_{tt}(x_0, -x_n, t) - c^2\Delta_{x}u(x_0, x_n, t) + c^2\Delta_{x}u(x_0, -x_n, t)  = f(x_0, x_n, t) - f(x_0, -x_n, t) = 0.\]
We also see that 
\[v(x, x_n, 0) = u(x_0, x_n,0) - u(x_0, -x_n, 0) = \phi(x_0, x_n) - \phi(x_0, -x_n)\]
and 
\[v_t(x, x_n, 0) =u_t(x_0, x_n,0) - u_t(x_0, -x_n, 0) = \psi(x_0, x_n) - \psi(x_0, -x_n). \]
So, $v$ solves the equation $v_{tt} - c^2\Delta_xv = 0$ with 0 initial conditions. We know that the only solution to this is $v=0$. Thus, we see that $u(x_0, x_n, t) - u(x_0, -x_n, t) = v(x_0, x_n, t) = 0$, so 
\[u(x_0, x_n, t) = u(x_0, -x_n, t),\]
and $u$ is even with respect to $x_n$, exactly as we wanted.
